HTTP
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), is a web technology for fetching resources, these include HTML documents, images, and videos. The client-server protocol allows clients (web browsers) to request resources, and the servers respond with the requested content. This protocol supports various operations, such as data fetching, posting, and updating pages dynamically. HTTP-based systems include components such as user-agents, servers, and proxies, this supports human-readable design. Allowing features  like HTTP/2 enhances efficiency and security. Features like persistent connections and secure encryption via HTTPS, overall improve performance and user trust.

Web
The web also uses the HTTP protocol for communication, facilitating the transfer and access of multimedia information, allowing users to interact and navigate the web's extensive content through links and URLs. Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), such as Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) are the most common, they break down the anatomy of a URL, to components: scheme, authority, and path. This together form the location of the web resources. Example of URL: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview
Uniform Resource Names (URNs) are used to identify resources by a particular namespace. They are persistent, location-independent identification, contrasting them with the location-based approach of URLs. Example of a URN: urn:ietf:rfc:7230
